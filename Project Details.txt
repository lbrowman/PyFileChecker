This is good for someone looking for a quick 5 star review.

I need a windows command line script that will:

I can set a directory to check
It checks this directory for the last modified file
If the last file modified was not modified within the last 20 minutes
Then, the script emails me

I need a way to run this script every 20 minutes.

I'm currently running Windows 7 if that makes a difference.

If this is something that you can do, then please respond with ready as the 1st word of your response.

Ready

I can get this up and running relatively quicky using python2.7, Monday January 16th being my earliest estimate and Wednesday January 18th my latest.
From my previous experience with windows servers and python i know we can set it to run using windows task manager once python and the required libraries have been installed. 
I intend to have a config file where you can set as many directories needed to check as necessary.
